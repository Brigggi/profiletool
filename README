Profile Tool Plugin

The Profile Plugin plots terrain profiles along interactive pointed polylines. It handles  any format supported by QGis. You can compare up to three layers together, control height scale and line colors. Unfortunately it has huge requirements: development version of QGIS and Qwt5.

Please send me your reflections, opinions, suggestions and wishes (especially related to this plugin;) on http://hub.qgis.org/projects/profiletool/issues
If you find this plugin useful please don't hesitate to let me know desired improvements!


REQUIREMENTS:
- Quantum GIS 1.0
- Qwt5 (python-qwt5-qt4)
- QT ver 4.1 for saving to PDF and 4.3 for saving to SVG

TO DO in the near future:
- threads for multi-window operation
- a better coordinates display and a mark on the canvas indicating cursor position when it is inside the profile graph
- export/import profile location to Shapefile
- export profile view to PNG
- customizable style for lines, axes and background
- customizable scales
- any other wishes :)
